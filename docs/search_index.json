New Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Understanding New Concepts\nBeing able to learn and unlearn new concepts is the fundamental skill required for effective collaboration.  \nYou are already very effective at solving problems in your own field with your own methods.  But the point of collaboration isn't to get more people implementing your methods. The goal of collaborative problem solving is gather a variety of experts and create new and hybrid lenses for understanding your problem. Then to invent solution methods that grow from this new understanding.\nIn order to contribute in this context you must be able to flexibly understand and adopt your collaborators' view-points. \nIndex\n\nBeing Wrong\nMental Models\nAsking Good Questions\nActivity\nResources\n\n\nBeing Wrong\nThe largest impediment to effective learning is an inability to admit you could be wrong.  \nThe traditional view on being wrong is that you are wrong.  If something you believe or know is wrong, that must mean that you are at fault.  This is far from the case.  Continuing to believe will lead to ineffective collaboration.  \nWhat follows is three ideas that will help you be gracefully wrong:\nIdeas vs. Identity\nThe ideas you have are not you.  Separating your pride and identity from the ideas you propose will enable smooth collaboration.  \nYou and the group can focus on navigating the problem and solutions spaces.\nContextual Truth\nRight and Wrong are contextual.  Your suggestions may be correct in your field of expertise, or in a previous project, but that does not mean they are right in every context.\nDifferent contexts come with a different set of relevant facts, and facts define truth.  \nYou must be aware of shifting contexts when assessing your ideas.\nPerspective-based Truth\nThere are more than one ways to interpret the same set of facts.  Depending on your background and motives you will interpret the same facts into a different truth.\nWhen working with a group you must be aware that it's possible for two seemingly contradictory propositions to be true.  \nThis is the strength of collaboration.  By accepting that there are multiple ways to view the same situation, you can begin to explore the apparent contradictions.

Effective Studying","keywords":"","body":"Effective Studying\nStudying is updating your mental models through effective questioning.\nEffective learning is possibly the most important skill you'll need in a collaborative environment. You will be continually confronted with new perspectives, new tools, and new knowledge.  You ability to internalize, integrate, apply your collaborators' views will be the most important factor to group success.\nMany factors will influence your ability to learn new material (motivation, previous experience with similar concepts, natural aptitude, time, competent guidance, ...).  Some of these factors are out of your control, having good study skills is not one of those.\nThis markdown has 4 sections: \n\nWhy practice studying\nWhat is studying\nHow to study\nSample study plan\nactivity\nresources\n\n\nWHY PRACTICE STUDYING?\n\nEffective studying is necessary for effective learning.\nStudying is just a skill like any other.\nSkills can be built through effortful repetition.\nEffortful repetition is a fancy way of saying practice.\n=> Practice Studying.QED.\n\nThe better you can study, the better you can learn anything.\n\nWHAT IS STUDYING?\nStudying seems simple - you sit there and learn stuff.  That is one way to do it but a very bad way.  Good studying is not that simple, it's a skill that takes discipline to learn.  What does it look like?\n\nGood studying is being your own teacher. \nGood studying requires a solid plan.\nSolid study plans look a lot like a lesson plan.\nGood lesson plans have a focus and an end point.\n\nFor good studying you need to be alternately your own teacher and your own student. \nA good plan is not only a list of topics and skills.  It also includes checkpoints, a well-defined final objective (usually a small project), and connections to important skills/concepts/objectives that lay outside of it's main focus.\n\nHOW TO STUDY WELL?\nBy finding the right answers to the right questions at the right time. \nThis is all around difficult, but especially difficult because you don't know what you don't know!  How can you have answers ready to questions you don't even have yet?\nTL;DR - Have a solid list of questions.  Keep updating that list as you progress until you manage to achieve your objective.\nThere is no single solution to this, but there are a few things you can do ahead of time to help your futur self:\n\nClearly define your objectives.\nThis will help you notice when you are straying off-topic.  The further you stray the more content you have to learn, the less unified that content is, and the harder it will be to achieve your goal.\n\n\nMake an initial high-level review of the subject matter.\nThis will help enourmously with staying on topic.  Before you begin your serious studying, make a drawing/list/table of your subject.  Indicate for yourselves which keywords or topics are important, which are cool, which are irrelevant, ... Having this prepared will help you know when you are straying off-topic in your studies.\n\n\nCollect and familiarize yourself good resources ahead of time.\nFinding a few reliable resources will save you a lot of trouble.  Not only won't you have to spend time looking later on, but it will make for a more comprehensive learning experience.  When you stick with a single resource (text book, video series, tutorial) you already know that it will explain things in a way that works for you.  You will also get more from the experience - larger single resources usually make an effort to make connections to past and futur sections.  This is not possible with an adhoc collection of blog posts, stack over flow answers, code snippets, short tutorials, ... what have you.\n\n\nMake frequent connections to concepts you already know - analogies rule.\nThe easiest way to gain a new skill is to repurpose a talent you already have.  The same goes for ideas.  If you're trying to understand context for example, spend a little extra time to draw up a good analogy or story.  This will help with remembering the material later, and with applying this knowledge in novel ways.\n\n\n\nSample study plan\ncoming soon\n\nSo that's studying.

Approaching Problems","keywords":"","body":"Approaching Problems\nIt's time to put your group to the test!\nThe goal of collaborative problem solving is gather a variety of experts and create new and hybrid lenses for understanding your problem. Then to invent solution methods that grow from this new understanding.\nTo do this, you can't jump right into creating your solution.  The first thing you'll have to do is carefully define the problem you're trying to address taking into account the diverse perspectives and experiences in your group.\nThis may feel like a waste of time when you already know how to solve the problem, but remember that isn't the point of collaborative problem solving!  You're not managing a team to implement your solution, you're working with other experts to find novel ways of solving your problem.\nYou can't find a truly novel solution without a truly novel perspective.\nIndex\n\nanalysis first\nconstraints   \ncommon constraints  \ndecomposition\nresources\n\n\nAnalysis First\nWhen presented with a new problem, it is a waste of time to start by trying to solve it.  The moment you begin thinking of solutions, you limit your energies to debating or improving the proposed solutions rather than looking for new perspectives on the problem.\nBefore even considering solutions, you should spend more time than you want to conidering the problem from every angle. This is also not intuitive, but a crucial skill to understand and practice.\nAs a developer, you are very rarely solving a problem that has been exactly solved before (or you'd be using someone else's code).  You will rarely have much guidance.  You will often have have a lot of freedom in coming up with your solution.  This is not the best situation for creative problem solving.\nYou must manage your time and your patience to maximize your efforts.  By spending extra time understading the problem then even more selecting the correct constraints for yourself, you will be saving yourself and your team time in the future.\n\n“Given one hour to save the world, I would spend 55 minutes defining the problem and 5 minutes finding the solution.” ~ Albert Einstein\n\nTOP\n\nConstraints\nConstraints force you to commit to one path and follow it through.  They force you to think creatively in order to work around them.  They force you to focus your energies onto a smaller set of possible solutions. Adding constraints improves and accelerates creative problem solving.\nIt may sound intuitively wrong, but the fewer restrictions you have on your work the more difficult it is to be creative.  One of the crucial skills you need to learn is when and how to place restrictions on yourself.  \nSpecs are a perfect example of self-imposed constraints that help enormously in producing a final product.  Without the structure of agreed-upon specs you would have to spend much more of your time remembering what you're doing and how it fits with the last piece you built.  \nOn the group level, specs are indispensible.  Without agreeing on specs before beginning to code, it's almost guarenteed that your team's code will not work when you piece it together.  By constraining yourselves to a set of specs, you are free as a group to take more liberties in implementation and workflow with the confidence that your project will work when everyone has finished their piece.\nTOP\n\nCommon Constraints\nHere's a quick look at the types of constraints a software developer will confront on a daily basis. While this list is written with developers in mind, you'll find that many of these sound familiar from your industry.\nThis list is long and it's not even near comprehensive.  Rather than looking it as an enormous list of shutdowns, try thinking of it as a bunch of decisions you don't have to make.  Free yourself!\nSome common constraints when developing software:\n\nThe audiences:\nA user must understand your applicaiton.\nDevelopers must understand your code.\nComputers must run your code.\n\n\nOther people\nBad legacy code\nUnpleasant team-mates\nBad junior developers\nEven worse senior developers\nBad managers\nImpossible customers\n\n\nYourself\nSkill/experience limitations\nTool familiarity\nBad work habits\nBad attitude\nPoor team-working skills\n\n\nDevelopment\nDeadlines\nBudgets\nSpecs\nUnexpected changes in any of these\nArchitecture \n\n\nTechnology stacks:\nProgramming languages\nFrameworks \nLack of frameworks\nCompatibility\n\n\nHardware, yours and users:\nSpeed\nPrice\nOS\n\n\nAnd so so many more ...\n\nTOP\n\nDecomposition\nProblem decomposition is central to problem solving.  Being able to look at a large problem and understand it as many small problems strung together will make you a better human.  \nSome of many advantages:      \n\nYou have created helpful constraints.  Two smaller problems are easier to approach and will usually result in a higher quality finished product.  \nCollaboration becomes easier. You can split work with the guarentee that each person's contribution will be valuable.  \nIt can guide the analysis phase.  Often the hardest question is how to start understanding a problem. by first decomposing a new problem, you can skip being confused by how to start.  Decomposing is always worth your time.  \nSmaller pieces are easier to code.  Decomposing large problems brings them closer to code, making the trasition to a practical solution much simpler.  \nApps built of smaller apps are almost always easier to test and maintain.  \n\nI'm sure there are more benefits to breaking down large problems, but these should be enough to convince you.  \nGetting good at this will just take practice.    \nTOP\n\nResources\nAnalysis First:\n\nProblem vs. Solution Oriented Thinking\nrockefeller\nanalysis paralysis\nA3\nmanaging to learn\ntriz\nlesswrong\n\nConstraints:\n\nfrom medium, david\ncreative constraints\nFrom photography\ntypes of constraints\nwired, to sciency?\nforbes\n\nProblem Decomposition:\n\nBBC decomposition \nBBC algorithms\n\n\n\n\n"},"05-Creating-Solutions/":{"url":"05-Creating-Solutions/","title":"6.
